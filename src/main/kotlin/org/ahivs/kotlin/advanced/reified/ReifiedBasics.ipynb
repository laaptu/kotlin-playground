This is the reason we needed ``inline``.  ``inline`` simply means that copy the code to the caller site. But when we do with ``reified``, it will not only copy but also allows us to add information about the type ``T`` to the caller site and paste the code along with the ``T`` type. If we didn't have ``inline``, then  it wouldn't be possible to maintain the type to the called function.  So due to this both of them go hand by hand."
